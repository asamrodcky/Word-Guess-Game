# hangman

This project is your basic rendition of Hangman. To begin, start typing out your letter "guesses" for the word in question. If your guess appears in the *Guessing* word, the blanks will automatically be populated with your guess. On the other hand, if your guess does not appear in the *Guessing* word then a guess will be deducted from your **"Total Number of Guesses"** and you may guess again.

The round ends when either you have successfully guessed a word correctly (win) or your "Number of Guesses" = 0 (lose). Once that has happened, click on the "Reset" button on the bottom of the page in order to load a different word and start the next round.

The audio file/player is there for your entertainment, use at your discretion.
